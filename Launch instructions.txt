Start the project by launching the client and server simultaneously. Then launch an additional client for multiplayer.

Player one moves with WASD. Player 2 moves with arrow keys.

THERE IS CURRENTLY AN ISSUE where collision will instantly trigger when a second player joins. Collision works with one client.
Comment out "window.close();" on line:156 in GameClient.cpp to temporarily disable collision to test the game with two players.
